FileMaker Theme Design Template
===============================

This collection of files provides a starting point for creating a new CSS3
based theme for FileMaker 12's new layout rendering.

As of this version, you need to know what you're doing. ;)

This template uses sass/compass to render the css. You won't find the css file
in this repository because it is generated by compass. More info at these links
